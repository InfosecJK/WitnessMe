</p>

My take on a Web Inventory tool, heavily inspired by [Eyewitness](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness). Takes screenshots of webpages using [Pyppeteer](https://github.com/miyakogi/pyppeteer) (headless Chrome/Chromium).

Supports Python 3.7+, fully asynchrounous and has extra bells & whistles that make life easier.

## Why & what problems does this solve

- Python 3.7+
- No dependency/installation hell, works on a variety of *nix flavors
- Asyncio provides Mad Max level speeds
- Headless chrome/chromium is the best.
- Provides a RESTful API.

## Installation

### Native

Natively installing WitnessMe is only reccomended if you intend to hack on the source code or you really can't install Docker on the system you're using.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/WitnessMe && cd WitnessMe
pip3 install --user pipenv && pipenv install --three
pipenv shell
(venv) python witnessme.py --help
```

### Docker

Building & running WitnessMe from a Docker container is fully supported and is the reccommended way of using the tool.

To build the docker image simply run:

```bash
docker build -t witnessme github.com/byt3bl33d3r/WitnessMe
```

You can then spin up a docker container, run it like the main `witnessme.py` script and pass it the same arguments:

```bash
docker run -v ~/scans:./scans --rm -ti witnessme https://google.com 192.168.0.1/24
```

To run `wmdb.py` after a scan completed:

```bash
docker run -v ~/scans:./scans --entrypoint wmdb.py ./scans/scan_folder --rm -ti witnessme
```

## Deploying to the Cloud (â„¢)

Since WitnessMe has a RESTful API now, you can deploy it to the magical cloud and perform scanning from there. This would have a number of benifits, including giving you a fresh external IP on every scan (More opsec safe when assessing attack surface on Red Teams).

There are a number of ways of doing this, you can obviously do it the traditional way (e.g. spin up a machine, install docker etc..).

Recently cloud service providers started offerring ways of running Docker containers directly in a fully managed environment. Think of it as serverless functions (e.g. AWS Lambdas) only with Docker containers.

This would technically allow you to really quickly deploy and run WitnessMe (or really anything in a Docker container) without having to worry about underlying infrastructure and removes a lot of the security concerns that come with that.

Below are some of the ones I've tried along with the steps necessary to get it going and any issues I encountered.

### GCP Cloud Run

Cloud Run is by far the easiest of these services to work with.

This repository includes the `cloudbuild.yaml` file necessary to get this setup and running.

**Unfortunetely, it seems like Cloud Run doesn't allow outbound internet access to containers, if anybody knows of a way to get around this please get in touch**

From the repositories root folder (after you authenticated and setup a project), these two commands will automatically build the Docker image, publish it to the Gcloud Container Registry and deploy a workging container to Cloud Run:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/witnessme --platform managed
```

The output will give you a HTTPS url to invoke the WitnessMe RESTful API from :)

When you're done:

```bash
gcloud run services delete witnessme
gcloud container images delete gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/witnessme
```

### AWS ECS/Fargate

TO DO

## Usage & Examples

There are 3 main scripts:

- `witnessme.py`: is the main CLI interface.
- `wmdb.py`: allows you to browse the database (created on each scan) to view results.
- `wmapi.py`: provides a RESTful API to schedule, start, stop and monitor scans.

```
usage: witnessme.py [-h] [-p PORTS [PORTS ...]] [--threads THREADS]
                    [--timeout TIMEOUT]
                    target [target ...]

positional arguments:
  target                The target IP(s), range(s), CIDR(s) or hostname(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PORTS [PORTS ...], --ports PORTS [PORTS ...]
                        Ports to scan if IP Range/CIDR is provided (default:
                        [80, 8080, 443, 8443])
  --threads THREADS     Number of concurrent threads (default: 25)
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Timeout for each connection attempt in seconds
                        (default: 35)
```

Can accept a mix of .Nessus file(s), Nmap XML file(s), files containing URLs and/or IPs, IP addresses/ranges/CIDRs and URLs. Long story short, should be able to handle anything you throw at it:

```bash
python witnessme.py 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.1.10-20 https://bing.com ~/my_nessus_scan.nessus ~/my_nmap_scan.xml ~/myfilewithURLSandIPs
```

*Note: as of writing, WitnessMe detects .Nessus and NMap files by their extension so make sure Nessus files have a `.nessus` extension and NMap scans have a `.xml` extension*

If an IP address/range/CIDR is specified as a target, WitnessMe will attempt to screenshot HTTP & HTTPS pages on ports 80, 8080, 443, 8443 by default. This is customizable with the `--port` argument.

Once a scan is completed, a folder with all the screenshots and a database will be in the current directory, point `wmdb.py` to the database in order to see the results.

```bash
python wmdb.py scan_2019_11_05_021237/witnessme.db
```

Pressing tab will show you the available commands and a help menu:

</p>

## Searching the Database

The `servers` and `hosts` commands in the `wmdb.py` CLI accept 1 argument. WMCLI is smart enough to know what you're trying to do with that argument

### Server Command

No arguments will show all discovered servers. Passing it an argument will search the `title` and `server` columns for that pattern (it's case insensitive).

For example if you wanted to search for all discovered Apache Tomcat servers:
- `servers tomcat` or `servers 'apache tomcat'`

Similarly if you wanted to find servers with a 'login' in the title:
- `servers login`

### Hosts Command

No arguments will show all discovered hosts. Passing it an argument will search the `IP` and `Hostname` columns for that pattern (it's case insensitive). If the value corresponds to a Host ID it will show you the host information and all of the servers discovered on that host which is extremely useful for reporting purposes and/or when targeting specific hosts.

### Signature Scan

You can perform a signature scan on all discovered services using the `scan` command.

## Call for Signatures!

If you run into a new webapp write a signature for it! It's beyond simple and they're all in YAML!

Don't believe me? Here's the AirOS signature (you can find them all in the [signatures directory](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/WitnessMe/tree/master/witnessme/signatures)):

```yaml
credentials:
- password: ubnt
  username: ubnt
name: AirOS
signatures:
- airos_logo.png
- form enctype="multipart/form-data" id="loginform" method="post"
- align="center" class="loginsubtable"
- function onLangChange()
# AirOS ubnt/ubnt
```

Yup that's it. Just plop it in the signatures folder and POW! Done.

# Preview Screenshots Directly in the Terminal (ITerm2 on MacOSX)

If you're using ITerm2 on MacOSX, you can preview screenshots directly in the terminal using the `show` command:

</p>

## To Do

1. ~~Store server info to a database~~
2. HTML report generation
3. ~~Cmdline script to search database~~
4. Support NMap & .nessus files as input *(Almost there, still some bugs but usable)*
5. Web server categorization & signature support
6. ~~Accept URLs as targets (cmdline, files)~~
7. Add support for previewing screenshots in *nix terminals using w3m
